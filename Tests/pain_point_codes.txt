Lathe chuck overtightend	18 V Drills too large to use with one hand	Disposable gloves are a large size	Miter saw is on tall table (awkward to use)	People forget to put away the clamps	Someone left sawdust and wood chips everywhere	Someone squeezed through aisle and bumped user (bumped e-stop)	Wood scraps too small to be useful	Digging through the unlabeled cabinets looking for drill	Trash bag is ripped	Had to wait for epoxy to cure
